Gravity, at least in part. This aloe, about 10 years old now, was planted on a slight slope. For the first few years of its life, it had been growing out towards the sun because its top had been shaded by a clumping bamboo. This year, even though its leaves were on the deflated side—the plant's water reserves fairly depleted after a dry winter and spring—the rosette on top of the 2-ft. stem was still heavy. Given these conditions, it wasn't that difficult for gravity to have its way.</div><div><br></div><div>A recurring irrigation issue may have made matters worse. Two sections of ¼-inch drip irrigation tubing inside the fence have repeatedly become separated, causing water to gush down the slope and into the street. As a result, the soil around this aloe and other plants in the area has gotten thoroughly soaked twice in the last three weeks. Combined with a couple of brief but intense heat waves, the excess moisture could have caused the stem to start rotting. I don't know for sure whether this has been a contributing factor, but it's possible.</div><div><br></div><div>If all of this sounds familiar, it's because it is. <a href=\"https://www.succulentsandmore.com/2020/08/gravity-always-wins.html\" target=\"_blank\">Last August</a>, our <i>Aloe ferox</i>, also growing at a slight angle and leaning forward, had done a similar faceplant.</div><div><br></div><div>Here's the <i>Aloe marlothii</i> after I dragged it into the street:</div><br><div><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1EAo6EpJZCs/YPIDcxjc6qI/AAAAAAACpfw/uzaMLW2YABoBYg8CsMHy82t2oHbqoW5IQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1500/PXL_20210716_172048433.jpg\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1EAo6EpJZCs/YPIDcxjc6qI/AAAAAAACpfw/uzaMLW2YABoBYg8CsMHy82t2oHbqoW5IQCLcBGAsYHQ/w640-h480/PXL_20210716_172048433.jpg\" data-original-width=\"1500\" width=\"640\" data-original-height=\"1125\" height=\"480\"></a></div><br><div>A friend of mine will reroot it and plant it in his own garden.

Seeing how <i>Aloe ferox</i> fell over in the summer of 2020 and <i>Aloe marlothii</i> in the summer of 2021, I firmly expect a similar event next year. I hope it won't be <i>Aloe</i> 'Erik the Red', my favorite among the taller aloes in our garden!</p><p><br></p><p><span>© Gerhard Bock, 2021. All rights reserved.
