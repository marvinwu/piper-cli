Let the soil dry between watering if you are in a humid climate.-Most of your growth will be during the warm season, and the plant will have the most leaves. The plant will also grow best with the leaves exposed to bright light, but the caudex shaded.-During the cool months, protect the plant from frost to keep it alive. The plant rests typically during this period, and water should be kept to a minimum. However, you can keep the plant active if you can keep it above 50 \u00b0F (10 \u00b0C).-Their sap is poisonous, and they should be handled with caution, particularly when pruning.-Most cuttings do not produce a caudex, so it is best to propagate by seeds. Adenias are either male or female, so one of each is required to produce seeds.-Learn more at How to Grow and Care for Adenia.", "_Description_content": "Adenia globosa is a deciduous shrub, often adopting a climbing habit, with stems up to 26.2 feet (8 m) long, growing from a globular, green and warty caudex up to 8.2 feet (2.5 m) in diameter.
